# <track-my-employee>

## Description

- The motivation for this project is to build and track profile's for employees.
- I built this project to sharpen my abilities with newfile types and new syntax.
- This project solves tracking employees and departments in a method that is applicable to real world websites.
- I learned how to begin utilizing back end web development.


## Usage

Follow the prompts from running the server to add and remove employees to the website.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
